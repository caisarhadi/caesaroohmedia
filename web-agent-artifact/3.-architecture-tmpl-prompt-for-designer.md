**Design Architect Prompt (UI Considerations)**

Based on the technical architecture defined, the following points should be considered by the Design Architect when proceeding with detailed UI/UX design and component specifications:

1.  Component Reusability & Philosophy: Leverage the planned Shadcn/ui-inspired component-based architecture (custom-built, accessible, Tailwind-styled components developed in Storybook). Design modular components for wide reuse.
2.  Dark/Light Mode: Ensure all UI designs and component states are specified for both themes, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast.
3.  Data-Driven UI: Design for dynamic rendering from JSON, GeoJSON, and Markdown. Plan for loading states (skeletons) and variations in content.
4.  Performance: Specify critical images for `next/image`. Identify potential `next/dynamic` candidates. Design GSAP animations to be performant and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
5.  Interactivity & State: Design clear visual feedback for state changes managed by Zustand. Define all interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled).
6.  Responsive Design: Mobile-first. Detail adaptations for complex UIs (map filters, inventory details) across breakpoints.
7.  Accessibility: Continue designing for WCAG 2.1 AA (keyboard navigation, ARIA).
8.  Specific UI Elements: Detail Drawer Navigation (GSAP animated), Vertical Twin Scrolling (GSAP, desktop), Horizontal Swiping (mobile), 360 Image Viewer integration, Sticky Utility Buttons.
9.  Contact Form: Design the UI for the contact form, keeping in mind it will submit to the self-hosted Next.js API route using Nodemailer. Include clear user feedback for submission success/failure.

The Design Architect will now proceed to create detailed UI specifications and mockups, aligning with this technical architecture and using the conceptual `2a-front-end-spec-tmpl.md` as a guide.
