| :---------------------------------------- | :-------- | :-------------- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization         | Compliant | None            |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment Sequencing | Compliant | None            |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations   | Compliant | None            |
| 4. User/Agent Responsibility Delineation  | Compliant | None            |
| 5. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies      | Compliant | None            |
| 6. MVP Scope Alignment                    | Compliant | None            |
| 7. Risk Management & Practicality         | Compliant | None            |
| 8. Documentation & Handoff                | Partially Compliant | User to clarify if formal end-user guides are needed for V1. Developer setup docs now tasked. |
| 9. Post-MVP Considerations                | Compliant | None. Analytics confirmed as optional for V1. |

**Critical Deficiencies:**
* None.

**Recommendations:**
* The primary outstanding point is for the **user to clarify if formal end-user guides are required for the V1 website.** If so, this needs to be added to the PRD scope. (Section 8.2)

**Final Decision:**
* **APPROVED:** The updated plan, as reflected in PRD v0.4, Frontend Architecture v0.3, and Overall Architecture v0.4, is comprehensive, addresses previous recommendations, and is ready for implementation. The documentation suite is in good shape to proceed to the next step.
