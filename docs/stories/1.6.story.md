# Story 1.6: Mapping Library Setup and Basic Wrapper

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up the mapping library and create a basic map wrapper component
- so that we have the foundation for the interactive mapping features throughout the application

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Mapping library (Mapbox GL JS or alternative) is installed and configured
2. Basic map wrapper component is created in `caesarooh/src/components/maps/MapWrapper.tsx`
3. Component supports essential map functionality (initialization, center, zoom, style)
4. Map state management is implemented using Zustand
5. Basic map interactions (pan, zoom, click) are properly handled
6. Component is responsive across device sizes
7. Map initialization is optimized for performance
8. A simple demonstration page or component is created to showcase the map functionality

## Technical Context

This story focuses on setting up the mapping library and creating a basic wrapper component as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Mapping Library**: Installation and configuration of the chosen mapping library (e.g., Mapbox GL JS)
2. **Map Wrapper Component**: Implementation of a reusable wrapper component
3. **Map State Management**: Zustand store for managing map state

Key references:
- Mapping requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- Map data models: `docs/data-models.md` (see sections on OOHInventoryItem and PointOfInterest)
- State management approach: `docs/front-end-state-management.md`
- Environment variables: `docs/environment-vars.md` (for API keys)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Mapping Library Selection and Setup**:
   - Install Mapbox GL JS (or the selected alternative)
   - Set up API key configuration using environment variables
   - Configure basic map initialization options

2. **Map Wrapper Component Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/components/maps/MapWrapper.tsx` as a flexible, reusable component
   - Implement core map initialization and configuration
   - Handle map events (load, move, zoom, click)
   - Create props API for customization

3. **Map State Management**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/store/mapStore.ts` using Zustand
   - Implement state for map center, zoom, bounds, style
   - Add actions for updating map state
   - Connect map component to store

4. **Responsive Implementation**:
   - Ensure map resizes properly with container
   - Optimize touch interactions for mobile devices
   - Handle viewport size changes appropriately

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement lazy loading for the map component
   - Optimize map initialization process
   - Add proper cleanup when component unmounts

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List

- This story sets up the mapping library and creates a basic wrapper component
- The implementation uses Zustand for state management of map properties
- Special attention is paid to performance optimization and responsive behavior
- The component is designed to be reusable across different sections of the site
- Mapbox GL JS was used as the mapping library with a direct API token for authentication
- MapWrapper component handles map initialization, state management, and event handling
- Key features implemented:
  - Responsive map container that adjusts to parent dimensions
  - Flexible prop API for customization (center, zoom, style)
  - Event handling for clicks, zoom, pan, and other map interactions
  - State management through Zustand store for global map state
  - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Prevention of infinite update loops through careful state management
- A demonstration page was created at /map-demo to showcase the map functionality
- Fixed circular dependency issues to prevent maximum update depth errors
