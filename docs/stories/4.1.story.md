# Story 4.1: Inventory Marketplace Core Services

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the core services and API routes for the Inventory Marketplace
- so that we have a foundation for fetching, filtering, and sorting inventory data

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Inventory service is implemented in `src/services/inventoryService.ts`
2. API route handler is created in `src/app/api/inventory/route.ts`
3. Data source is set up in `src/content/inventory.json`
4. API supports filtering inventory items by multiple criteria
5. API supports sorting inventory items by different fields
6. API supports pagination of results
7. Service includes TypeScript type definitions for inventory data
8. Error handling is implemented for API and service operations
9. Unit tests are created for service and API functionality

## Technical Context

This story focuses on implementing the core services and API routes for the Inventory Marketplace as specified in Epic 4. Key components:

1. **Inventory Service**: Client-side service for interacting with inventory API
2. **API Route Handler**: Server-side API for fetching and filtering inventory data
3. **Data Source**: JSON file containing inventory items for V1

Key references:
- Inventory Marketplace requirements: `docs/epic-4.md`
- Inventory data model: `docs/data-models.md` (see OOHInventoryItem section)
- API implementation approach: From Story 1.7
- API structure: `docs/api-reference.md` (see Inventory API section)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Inventory Service Implementation**:
   - Create `src/services/inventoryService.ts` for client-side API interaction
   - Implement methods for fetching, filtering, and sorting inventory data
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for inventory data types
   - Add error handling and response processing
   - Implement caching strategy if needed

2. **API Route Handler**:
   - Implement `src/app/api/inventory/route.ts` using Next.js Route Handlers
   - Create GET method with query parameter support
   - Implement filtering logic for multiple criteria
   - Add sorting functionality by different fields
   - Set up pagination with limit and offset parameters

3. **Data Source Setup**:
   - Create `src/content/inventory.json` with sample inventory data
   - Structure data according to the OOHInventoryItem model
   - Include various item types for testing filters
   - Add realistic sample data for UI testing

4. **Filter Implementation**:
   - Support filtering by location (region, city)
   - Add filtering by inventory type (billboard, digital, etc.)
   - Implement filtering by price range
   - Support filtering by availability
   - Add additional relevant filters based on requirements

5. **Sort Implementation**:
   - Support sorting by price (ascending/descending)
   - Add sorting by location
   - Implement sorting by popularity or relevance
   - Support sorting by date added
