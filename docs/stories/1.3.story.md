# Story 1.3: Storybook Setup and Foundational UI Components

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up Storybook and implement foundational UI components
- so that we have a component development environment and reusable UI elements

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Storybook is installed and configured for isolated component development
2. Basic Storybook documentation is set up with introduction and guidelines
3. Common UI components are developed and documented in Storybook:
   - Button (primary, secondary, outline variants)
   - Card shells
   - Basic Icons system
   - Form input wrappers (text, select, checkbox, radio)
4. Components follow responsive design principles
5. Components support both dark and light themes
6. Components meet accessibility standards (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
7. Visual tests are configured for components in Storybook

## Technical Context

This story builds on the foundation and theme system from Stories 1.1 and 1.2, focusing on setting up Storybook and implementing foundational UI components as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Storybook Setup**: Configuration for isolated component development and documentation
2. **Common UI Components**: Development of reusable UI elements following Shadcn/ui-inspired approach
3. **Visual Testing**: Configuration of visual tests for UI components

Key references:
- Component requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- Front-end architecture: `docs/front-end-architecture.md` and `docs/2-front-end-spec.md`
- Component style guide: `docs/front-end-style-guide.md`
- Testing strategy: `docs/front-end-testing-strategy.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **Storybook Configuration**:
   - Install Storybook and related dependencies
   - Configure Storybook for Next.js and TypeScript
   - Set up Tailwind CSS support in Storybook
   - Configure theme switching in Storybook
   - Create documentation pages for component usage

2. **UI Component Development Approach**:
   - Follow Shadcn/ui-inspired philosophy: custom, composable, accessible components
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Support both dark and light themes using theme context from Story 1.2
   - Ensure responsive behavior
   - Implement proper accessibility features

3. **Component Implementations**:
   - **Button**: Create variants (primary, secondary, outline) with consistent styling
   - **Card**: Implement card shells with flexible content areas
   - **Icons**: Set up basic icon system (using SVGs or icon library)
   - **Form Inputs**: Create base wrappers for text inputs, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons

4. **Visual Testing Setup**:
   - Configure Storybook's visual testing capabilities
   - Set up snapshot tests for components
   - Create test cases for different states and variants
