# Story 1.7: API Service Modules and Email Setup

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up API service modules and email functionality
- so that we have a foundation for data fetching and contact form submission

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Nodemailer is installed and configured for email sending
2. Contact form API route is implemented in `caesarooh/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
3. Base API client wrapper is created in `caesarooh/src/services/apiClient.ts`
4. Form service module is implemented in `caesarooh/src/services/formService.ts`
5. Environment variables are properly configured for email settings
6. Error handling is implemented for API and email operations
7. Basic validation is added for form submissions
8. Testing utilities are created for mocking API calls

## Technical Context

This story focuses on setting up the API service modules and email functionality as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Nodemailer Setup**: Installation and configuration for handling email sending
2. **API Route Handlers**: Implementation of Next.js API routes for backend functionality
3. **Service Modules**: Creation of client-side service modules for data fetching and form handling

Key references:
- API requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- API structure: `docs/api-reference.md`
- Environment variables: `docs/environment-vars.md` (for email configuration)
- Contact form data model: `docs/data-models.md` (see ContactFormPayload section)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Nodemailer Configuration**:
   - Install Nodemailer and required dependencies
   - Set up email configuration using environment variables
   - Create utility functions for email sending
   - Implement error handling and logging

2. **API Route Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/app/api/contact/route.ts` using Next.js Route Handlers
   - Implement POST method for form submission
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Connect to Nodemailer for email sending

3. **API Client Wrapper**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/services/apiClient.ts` as a base wrapper for fetch calls
   - Implement error handling and response parsing
   - Add request/response interceptors if needed
   - Configure default headers and options

4. **Form Service Module**:
   - Implement `caesarooh/src/services/formService.ts` for contact form handling
   - Create methods for submitting form data
   - Add validation functions
   - Implement error handling and user feedback

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up required environment variables for email
   - Create documentation for required variables
   - Implement validation for required configuration

  - [x] Create client-side validation in form service
  - [x] Add proper error messages
  - [x] Implement validation utility functions

- [x] Create Testing Utilities (AC: 8)
  - [x] Implement API mocking utilities (`caesarooh/src/lib/__tests__/apiMocks.ts`)
  - [x] Create test helpers for API services (Included in mocks and individual tests)
  - [x] Add mock response data (In `apiMocks.ts`)
  - [x] Create utility for testing form validation (Implicitly covered by form service tests)

## Testing Approach

1. **API Route Testing**:
   - Test route handler functionality
   - Verify validation and error handling
   - Check email sending integration
   - Test different request scenarios

2. **Service Module Testing**:
   - Test API client wrapper methods
   - Verify form service functionality
   - Test validation logic
   - Check error handling

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test form submission flow end-to-end
   - Verify data flow from client to server
   - Check email sending process
   - Test error scenarios and user feedback

4. **Environment Configuration Testing**:
   - Verify environment variables are properly loaded
   - Test validation of required settings
   - Check fallback behavior for missing variables
