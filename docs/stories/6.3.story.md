# Story 6.3: Marker Components and Info Panels

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the marker components and info panels for OOH sites and POIs
- so that users can visualize and interact with inventory items on the map

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. OOH marker component is implemented in `caesarooh/src/components/map/OOHMarker.tsx`
2. POI marker component is implemented in `caesarooh/src/components/map/POIMarker.tsx`
3. OOH site info panel is implemented in `caesarooh/src/components/map/OOHSiteInfoPanel.tsx`
4. Markers display on the map with distinct styling for OOH sites and POIs
5. Markers respond to click events to display info panels
6. Info panels show relevant details including an option to trigger 360 view if available
7. Components support both dark and light themes
8. Components are responsive and display correctly on all device sizes
9. Unit and integration tests are created for all components

## Technical Context

This story builds on Stories 6.1 and 6.2 to implement the marker components and info panels for the Advanced Mapping Page as specified in Epic 6. Key components:

1. **OOH Marker**: Visual representation of OOH inventory sites on the map
2. **POI Marker**: Visual representation of Points of Interest on the map
3. **OOH Site Info Panel**: Detailed information panel for selected OOH sites

Key references:
- Map Page requirements: `docs/epic-6.md`
- Map service and store: From Story 6.1 (`caesarooh/src/services/mapService.ts` and `caesarooh/src/stores/mapStore.ts`)
- Map wrapper component: From Story 6.2 (`caesarooh/src/components/map/MapWrapper.tsx`)
- 360 viewer component: From Story 5.3 (`caesarooh/src/components/inventory/ThreeSixtyViewerWrapper.tsx`)

## Implementation Notes

   - Create different marker styles for various POI categories
   - Ensure performance with multiple markers

3. **OOH Site Info Panel Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/components/map/OOHSiteInfoPanel.tsx` component
   - Display detailed information about selected OOH site
   - Add embedded map snippet for context if needed
   - Implement 360 view trigger if available
   - Create responsive layout for different devices
   - Add close and navigation controls

4. **Marker and Panel Integration**:
   - Connect markers to the map component
   - Implement event handling between markers and panels
   - Manage selection state through the map store
   - Create smooth transitions for panel display
   - Optimize performance for multiple markers
