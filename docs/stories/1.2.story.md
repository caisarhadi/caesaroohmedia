# Story 1.2: Global Layout Structure and Theme Provider

## Status: In-Progress

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the global layout structure and theme provider
- so that we have a consistent UI framework with dark/light mode support

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Root layout is implemented in `caesarooh/src/app/layout.tsx` with basic structure
2. Main group layout is created in `caesarooh/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`
3. Shell components for Header and Footer are implemented
4. ThemeProvider is implemented using Zustand for state management
5. Dark/Light mode switching works correctly with Tailwind CSS
6. Theme preference is persisted in localStorage
7. All layouts and theme components are responsive and follow design guidelines
8. Basic accessibility features are implemented for all layout components

## Technical Context

This story builds on the foundation from Story 1.1, focusing on implementing the global layout structure and theme provider as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Root Layout**: Created in `caesarooh/src/app/layout.tsx` as the base layout for the entire application
2. **Main Group Layout**: Created in `caesarooh/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` for the main content sections
3. **ThemeProvider**: Implemented using Zustand for state management and localStorage for persistence

Key references:
- Layout requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- UI Store requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- Project structure: `docs/project-structure.md` (Component View section)
- Component architecture: `docs/front-end-architecture.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **Root Layout Structure**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/app/layout.tsx` with HTML structure, metadata, and global providers
   - Include CSS imports for global styles and Tailwind
   - Implement SEO-related metadata using Next.js metadata API

2. **Main Group Layout**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` to wrap main content pages
   - Include Header and Footer components
   - Add responsive container constraints

3. **Header & Footer Components**:
   - Create shell components in `caesarooh/src/components/layout/`
   - Implement responsive behavior for mobile and desktop
   - Include theme toggle button in the header

4. **Theme Provider Implementation**:
   - Create Zustand store in `caesarooh/src/store/uiStore.ts` with theme state
   - Implement ThemeProvider component in `caesarooh/src/contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx`
   - Use `useEffect` to sync theme with localStorage and body class
   - Create theme toggle button component

5. **Theme System Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind's dark mode with `class` strategy
   - Toggle between 'light' and 'dark' themes
   - Support system preference detection with `prefers-color-scheme` media query
   - Persist user selection in localStorage

  - [x] Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
  - [x] Test with screen readers

## Testing Approach

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Test ThemeProvider functionality
   - Verify theme toggle behavior
   - Test localStorage persistence

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Verify responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
   - Ensure correct styling in both light and dark modes
   - Check that all components render correctly

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify semantic HTML
   - Check ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen reader

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List

- This story implements the core layout structure and theme functionality
- The theme implementation uses Zustand for state management as specified in Epic 1
- All components should follow the responsive design patterns
- Accessibility is a key consideration for all components
- Theme toggle needs additional work to ensure readability in light mode

### Change Log

- Created Zustand UI store in `caesarooh/src/store/uiStore.ts` with theme state management
- Implemented ThemeProvider component in `caesarooh/src/contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- Created useTheme hook in `caesarooh/src/hooks/useTheme.ts` for simplified theme management
- Implemented ThemeToggle component in `caesarooh/src/components/common/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Created Header component with responsive mobile navigation in `caesarooh/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- Implemented Footer component with responsive layout in `caesarooh/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
- Updated root layout in `caesarooh/src/app/layout.tsx` to use ThemeProvider
- Integrated Header and Footer in the root layout `caesarooh/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Updated homepage content in `caesarooh/src/app/page.tsx` for testing layout
- Fixed theme toggle consistency across page navigation
- Improved useTheme hook to properly handle theme persistence across pages
- Modified ThemeProvider to simplify its implementation
- Added placeholder pages for all navigation links to ensure proper routing
- Updated Header component to use usePathname for active route tracking
- Refactored navigation code in Header to use a centralized navigation items array
- Improved mobile menu to auto-close on navigation
- Enhanced responsive behavior for all components
- Updated homepage to use Next.js Link components for proper client-side navigation
- **Known Issue:** Theme toggle lacks sufficient contrast in light mode
