# Story 4.2: Inventory Listing View Implementation

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the Inventory Listing View with filtering, sorting, and skeleton loading
- so that users can browse, filter, and sort OOH media inventory items with a smooth experience

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Inventory listing page is created in `src/app/inventory/page.tsx` with SSR
2. InventoryCard component is implemented in `src/components/inventory/InventoryCard.tsx`
3. InventoryFilterPanel component is created in `src/components/inventory/InventoryFilterPanel.tsx`
4. Page displays inventory items with server-side rendering for initial load
5. Filtering UI allows filtering by multiple criteria (location, type, price, etc.)
6. Sorting options are implemented for different fields
7. Skeleton loading is displayed while data is being fetched or filtered
8. Filter panel is responsive and user-friendly on all devices
9. Page integrates with inventoryService.ts from Story 4.1
10. Dark/light mode styling is properly applied to all components

## Technical Context

This story builds on the core services implemented in Story 4.1 to create the Inventory Listing View as specified in Epic 4. Key components:

1. **Inventory Listing Page**: Main page for browsing inventory with SSR
2. **InventoryCard Component**: Card displaying individual inventory items
3. **InventoryFilterPanel Component**: UI for filtering and sorting items
4. **Skeleton Loading**: Loading state while data is being fetched

Key references:
- Inventory Marketplace requirements: `docs/epic-4.md`
- Inventory service: From Story 4.1 (`src/services/inventoryService.ts`)
- Inventory data model: `docs/data-models.md` (see OOHInventoryItem section)
- Design and layout: `docs/front-end-style-guide.md` and `docs/2-front-end-spec.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **Inventory Listing Page Structure**:
   - Create `src/app/inventory/page.tsx` using Next.js App Router
   - Implement server-side rendering for initial data load
   - Create appropriate layout with filter panel and results grid
   - Add client-side data fetching for filter/sort updates

2. **InventoryCard Component**:
   - Create `src/components/inventory/InventoryCard.tsx` component
   - Design card layout with image, title, price, location, etc.
   - Implement hover and focus states
   - Add link to detail page (placeholder for now)
   - Create skeleton loading variant

3. **InventoryFilterPanel Component**:
   - Implement `src/components/inventory/InventoryFilterPanel.tsx`
   - Create form controls for various filter options
   - Add sorting dropdown or buttons
   - Implement responsive behavior for mobile
   - Create clear filters functionality

4. **Skeleton Loading Implementation**:
   - Create skeleton variants of card components
   - Implement loading state management
   - Use Tailwind's animate-pulse or similar
   - Ensure smooth transition from loading to data

5. **Filter and Sort Integration**:
   - Connect filter UI to inventoryService
   - Implement client-side state for filter/sort options
   - Add URL parameter syncing for shareable filters
   - Create responsive filter panel for mobile

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure proper grid layout on desktop
   - Implement collapsible filter panel on mobile
   - Create breakpoint-specific layouts
   - Optimize for touch devices
