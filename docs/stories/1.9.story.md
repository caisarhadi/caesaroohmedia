# Story 1.9: Testing Environment Setup

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up the frontend testing environment
- so that we have a comprehensive framework for testing application components and functionality

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Jest and React Testing Library are installed and configured for unit/component testing
2. Playwright is set up for end-to-end testing
3. Test execution scripts are added to package.json (test, test:e2e, test:watch)
4. Common test helpers and utilities are created
5. Mock setups are implemented (API calls, Zustand stores, browser environment)
6. Test environment is configured to work with Next.js App Router
7. Example tests are created for each test type (unit, component, e2e)
8. Testing documentation is created with guidelines and best practices

## Technical Context

This story focuses on setting up the testing environment for the application as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Jest Setup**: Configuration for unit and component testing
2. **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
3. **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing
4. **Test Utilities**: For mocking and test helpers

   - Check event handling and state updates
   - Test with different component types

3. **E2E Testing Verification**:
   - Verify Playwright configuration
   - Test browser launching and navigation
   - Check test fixtures and utilities
   - Ensure page interactions work

4. **Mock Verification**:
   - Test API mocking utilities
