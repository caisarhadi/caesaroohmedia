# Story 1.9: Testing Environment Setup

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up the frontend testing environment
- so that we have a comprehensive framework for testing application components and functionality

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Jest and React Testing Library are installed and configured for unit/component testing
2. Playwright is set up for end-to-end testing
3. Test execution scripts are added to package.json (test, test:e2e, test:watch)
4. Common test helpers and utilities are created
5. Mock setups are implemented (API calls, Zustand stores, browser environment)
6. Test environment is configured to work with Next.js App Router
7. Example tests are created for each test type (unit, component, e2e)
8. Testing documentation is created with guidelines and best practices

## Technical Context

This story focuses on setting up the testing environment for the application as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **Jest Setup**: Configuration for unit and component testing
2. **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
3. **Playwright**: For end-to-end testing
4. **Test Utilities**: For mocking and test helpers

Key references:
- Testing requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- Testing strategy: `docs/front-end-testing-strategy.md`
- Testing decisions: `docs/testing-decisions.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **Jest and React Testing Library Setup**:
   - Install Jest, React Testing Library, and related dependencies
   - Configure Jest for Next.js and TypeScript
   - Set up test environment for React components
   - Create Jest configuration file with appropriate settings

2. **Playwright Setup**:
   - Install Playwright and configure for e2e testing
   - Set up browser configurations
   - Create base test fixtures and utilities
   - Implement page object patterns for testing

3. **Test Script Configuration**:
   - Add test scripts to package.json
   - Configure watch mode for development
   - Set up code coverage reporting
   - Create specialized test commands as needed

4. **Test Utilities Implementation**:
   - Create common test helpers in `caesarooh/src/test-utils/`
   - Implement API mocking utilities
   - Add Zustand store mocking
   - Create browser environment mocks

5. **Example Test Creation**:
   - Implement unit test examples
   - Create component test samples
   - Add e2e test examples
   - Document testing patterns

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Testing Verification**:
   - Verify Jest configuration works correctly
   - Test the test utilities themselves
   - Ensure TypeScript integration works
   - Check coverage reporting

2. **Component Testing Verification**:
   - Test React Testing Library setup
   - Verify component rendering
   - Check event handling and state updates
   - Test with different component types

3. **E2E Testing Verification**:
   - Verify Playwright configuration
   - Test browser launching and navigation
   - Check test fixtures and utilities
   - Ensure page interactions work

4. **Mock Verification**:
   - Test API mocking utilities
   - Verify store mocks function correctly
   - Check browser environment mocks
   - Test integration with components
