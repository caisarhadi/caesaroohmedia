# Story 1.5: Twin Scrolling Foundation with GSAP ScrollTrigger

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the foundation for vertical twin scrolling using GSAP ScrollTrigger
- so that the site can feature synchronized, parallax-style scrolling sections for enhanced user experience

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin is installed and configured
2. Twin scrolling component foundation is implemented in `caesarooh/src/components/animations/TwinScroll.tsx`
3. The component supports synchronized scrolling between two content sections
4. Proper scroll-based animations are implemented using GSAP ScrollTrigger
5. The component handles responsive behavior (desktop implementation with fallback for mobile)
6. Performance optimizations are implemented to ensure smooth scrolling
7. ScrollTrigger cleanup is handled properly to prevent memory leaks
8. A demonstration page or section is created to showcase the twin scrolling functionality

## Technical Context

This story builds on the GSAP setup from Story 1.4, focusing on implementing the foundation for vertical twin scrolling using GSAP ScrollTrigger as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **ScrollTrigger Setup**: Configuration of GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll-based animations
2. **Twin Scrolling Component**: Implementation of a reusable component for synchronized, parallax-style scrolling
3. **Responsive Handling**: Logic to handle different viewport sizes with appropriate fallbacks

Key references:
- Twin scrolling requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (see "Twin scrolling foundation" specification)
- GSAP integration: `docs/epic-1.md` and existing setup from Story 1.4
- Responsive design considerations: `docs/front-end-style-guide.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **ScrollTrigger Configuration**:
   - Ensure ScrollTrigger plugin is properly imported and registered
   - Configure ScrollTrigger default settings for smooth animation
   - Set up debugging tools for development

2. **Twin Scrolling Component Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/components/animations/TwinScroll.tsx` as a flexible, reusable component
   - Implement the core twin scrolling logic using ScrollTrigger
   - Support customizable animation effects and timing
   - Ensure proper cleanup when component unmounts

3. **Responsive Implementation**:
   - Implement full twin scrolling for desktop viewports
   - Create appropriate fallback for mobile devices (e.g., standard stacked sections)
   - Use media queries or JavaScript-based detection for responsive switching

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
   - Use CSS transforms instead of position properties when possible
   - Apply GPU acceleration for smoother animations
   - Optimize DOM operations and reflows

5. **Demo Implementation**:
   - Create a demonstration page or section to showcase the twin scrolling
   - Include sample content to visualize the effect
   - Allow for testing different configurations

## Testing Approach

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Test component rendering and props
   - Verify ScrollTrigger integration
   - Test component lifecycle and cleanup

2. **Scroll Animation Testing**:
   - Verify scroll animations work correctly
   - Test performance across devices
   - Ensure no animation bugs on different browsers

3. **Responsive Testing**:
   - Test desktop implementation
   - Verify mobile fallback behavior
   - Check transition between viewport sizes

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Monitor frame rate during scrolling
   - Check for jank or stuttering
   - Verify memory usage and potential leaks
