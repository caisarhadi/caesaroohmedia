# Story 1.4: Advanced Drawer Navigation with GSAP

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement an advanced drawer navigation system using GSAP
- so that users have a smooth, animated navigation experience that works across all devices

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. GSAP is installed and configured for animation
2. Drawer navigation component is implemented in `src/components/layout/DrawerNavigation.tsx`
3. Drawer can be opened and closed with smooth animations
4. Navigation links are properly styled and respond to active state
5. Drawer state is managed in the Zustand uiStore
6. Animations work correctly on both mobile and desktop views
7. Drawer navigation meets accessibility standards (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
8. GSAP utility functions are created for common animation patterns

## Technical Context

This story builds on the layout and theme system from Stories 1.1-1.3, focusing on implementing advanced drawer navigation using GSAP as specified in Epic 1. Key components:

1. **GSAP Setup**: Configuration and integration of GreenSock Animation Platform
2. **Drawer Navigation**: Implementation of an animated drawer navigation component
3. **Animation Utilities**: Creation of reusable GSAP utility functions

Key references:
- Navigation requirements: `docs/epic-1.md` (Key Frontend Implementation Details section)
- GSAP integration: `docs/epic-1.md` (see "Advanced drawer navigation" specification)
- UI Store extensions: `docs/epic-1.md` (for drawer state management)
- Accessibility requirements: `docs/front-end-coding-standards.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **GSAP Installation and Setup**:
   - Install GSAP and related plugins (ScrollTrigger, etc.)
   - Create utility functions in `src/lib/gsap-utils.ts` for common animations
   - Configure GSAP for use with Next.js and React

2. **Drawer Component Implementation**:
   - Create `src/components/layout/DrawerNavigation.tsx` component
   - Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views
   - Add toggle button in Header component from Story 1.2
   - Create smooth open/close animations using GSAP

3. **State Management**:
   - Extend `src/store/uiStore.ts` with drawer state:
     - isDrawerOpen: boolean
     - openDrawer(): void
     - closeDrawer(): void
     - toggleDrawer(): void
   - Connect drawer component to store

4. **Navigation Content**:
   - Implement navigation links with active state styling
   - Create nested navigation structure if needed
   - Add appropriate icons and visual elements

5. **Accessibility Implementation**:
   - Add keyboard navigation (Escape to close, Tab navigation)
   - Implement proper focus management
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes and roles
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Implement open/close/toggle actions
  - [x] Add tests for drawer state management

- [x] Implement Drawer Navigation Component (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create `src/components/layout/DrawerNavigation.tsx`
  - [x] Implement basic structure and styling
  - [x] Add navigation links and active state handling
  - [x] Connect to uiStore for state management

- [x] Create GSAP Animations (AC: 3, 6, 8)
  - [x] Implement open animation with GSAP
  - [x] Implement close animation with GSAP
  - [x] Create animation utilities for reuse
  - [x] Test animations across device sizes

- [x] Update Header Component (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add drawer toggle button to Header
  - [x] Style toggle button for both themes
  - [x] Implement toggle button animation

- [x] Implement Responsive Design (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create mobile-specific drawer behavior (slide-in panel for <lg screens)
  - [x] Implement desktop-specific drawer behavior (drawer toggle is hidden on >lg screens, ensuring no interference)
  - [x] Test on various viewport sizes

- [x] Implement Accessibility Features (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add keyboard navigation support (Escape key, Tab trapping)
  - [x] Implement focus management (Initial focus, return focus, trap focus)
  - [x] Add ARIA attributes and roles (aria-modal, role, aria-label, aria-hidden)
  - [x] Test with screen readers

- [x] Document in Storybook
  - [x] Create drawer navigation story
  - [x] Document usage and animation options
  - [x] Provide examples of different states

## Testing Approach

1. **Component Testing**:
   - Test drawer open/close functionality
   - Verify store integration
   - Test keyboard interactions

2. **Animation Testing**:
   - Verify animations work correctly
   - Test performance across devices
   - Ensure no animation bugs on different browsers

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify focus management
   - Check ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen readers

## Story Progress Notes

### Agent Model Used: `Claude 3.7 Sonnet`

### Completion Notes List

- This story implements advanced drawer navigation using GSAP for animations
- The drawer state is managed through the Zustand uiStore created in previous stories
- Accessibility is a key consideration for the drawer navigation
- GSAP utility functions should be reusable for other animation needs
