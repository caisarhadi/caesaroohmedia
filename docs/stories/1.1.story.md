# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to set up the project foundation with Next.js, TypeScript, and core tooling
- so that we have a robust starting point for the CAESAR OOH MEDIA website modernization

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Next.js project is initialized with TypeScript using `create-next-app --typescript`
2. Git repository is set up with initial commit and defined branching strategy (Gitflow)
3. ESLint and Prettier are installed and configured for code linting and formatting
4. A comprehensive README.md file is created with project overview, tech stack, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines
5. Project structure follows the architectural documentation with appropriate directories (app, components, store, hooks, lib, services, styles, types, content)
6. Tailwind CSS is installed and configured correctly with dark/light mode support
7. Basic configuration files (.gitignore, .eslintrc.js, tsconfig.json, etc.) are properly set up
8. CI/CD pipeline foundation is established (e.g., GitHub Actions) for linting, testing, and basic build

## Technical Context

This story implements the foundation described in Epic 1, focusing on project setup and tooling configuration. The project will use:

1. **Next.js v14+**: Latest version with App Router and TypeScript support
2. **Tailwind CSS v4.x**: For utility-first styling with dark/light mode capability 
3. **ESLint & Prettier**: For code quality and consistent formatting
4. **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
5. **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline automation

Key references:
- Architecture overview: `docs/3.-architecture.md` (Technical Summary section)
- Project structure: `docs/project-structure.md` (Component View section)
- Technology stack: `docs/tech-stack.md`

## Implementation Notes

1. **Project Structure**: Follow the structure outlined in `docs/project-structure.md`:
   - `/src/app`: For Next.js App Router pages and layouts
   - `/src/components`: For React components (initially empty except for placeholders)
   - `/src/store`: For Zustand stores (initially empty)
   - `/src/hooks`, `/src/lib`, `/src/services`: For respective code organization
   - `/src/styles`: For Tailwind configuration and global styles
   - `/src/types`: For TypeScript type definitions
   - `/src/content`: For local data files (initially empty)

2. **Tailwind Configuration**: Configure Tailwind for dark/light mode support:
   - Set up dark mode variant using 'class' strategy for user toggling
   - Create a basic theme with primary, secondary, and neutral color scales
   - Add utility classes for common patterns based on design system

3. **Git & GitHub Setup**:
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Set up branches: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`, `release/*`
   - Document branching strategy in README.md

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for linting, type checking, and testing
   - Configure build verification step
   - Add status badges to README.md

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `create-next-app --typescript` with appropriate project name
  - [x] Review generated files and adjust as needed
- [x] Set up Git repository (AC: 2)
  - [x] Initialize Git repo and create initial commit
  - [x] Document branching strategy (Gitflow) in README.md
  - [x] Set up .gitignore file with appropriate entries
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier (AC: 3)
  - [x] Install ESLint, Prettier and related plugins
  - [x] Create configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc)
  - [x] Add lint scripts to package.json
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md (AC: 4)
  - [x] Include project overview and vision
  - [x] Document technology stack
  - [x] Add detailed setup instructions
  - [x] Include build/run commands
  - [x] Add testing instructions and contribution guidelines
- [x] Establish project directory structure (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create directories according to architecture docs
  - [x] Add placeholder README files in each directory explaining purpose
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS with dark/light mode (AC: 6)
  - [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Set up dark mode configuration
  - [x] Create basic color variables and theme definitions
- [x] Configure TypeScript (AC: 7)
  - [x] Review and adjust tsconfig.json as needed
  - [x] Set up path aliases for easier imports
- [x] Establish CI/CD pipeline foundation (AC: 8)
  - [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow file for linting and testing
  - [x] Set up build verification process
  - [x] Test pipeline to ensure it works properly

## Testing Approach

1. **Linting and Type Checking**:
   - Verify ESLint runs without errors
   - Ensure TypeScript type checking passes
   - Confirm Prettier formats code as expected

2. **Build Verification**:
   - Next.js build should complete successfully
   - No TypeScript errors should be present
   - No console warnings during build process

3. **CI Pipeline Validation**:
   - GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully on push to main/develop
   - All checks (lint, typecheck, build) should pass
