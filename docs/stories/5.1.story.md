# Story 5.1: Inventory Detail API and Service

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the Inventory Detail API and service
- so that we can fetch comprehensive data for individual inventory items

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. API route handler is created in `src/app/api/inventory/[id]/route.ts`
2. Inventory service is extended to support fetching individual items by ID
3. API returns detailed inventory item data including specifications, images, and location
4. Error handling is implemented for invalid IDs or missing items
5. Sample inventory data includes comprehensive details suitable for detail pages
6. TypeScript interfaces are defined for detailed inventory item data
7. API and service support caching for performance optimization
8. Unit tests are created for the API and service functionality

## Technical Context

This story focuses on implementing the Inventory Detail API and extending the inventory service to support fetching individual items as specified in Epic 5. Key components:

1. **API Route Handler**: Server-side API for fetching individual inventory items
2. **Inventory Service Extension**: Enhanced client-side service for detailed item data
3. **Data Structure**: Comprehensive data model for inventory items

Key references:
- Inventory Detail requirements: `docs/epic-5.md`
- Inventory service: From Story 4.1 (`src/services/inventoryService.ts`)
- Inventory data model: `docs/data-models.md` (see OOHInventoryItem section)
- API structure: `docs/api-reference.md` (see Inventory API section)

## Implementation Notes

1. **API Route Handler Implementation**:
   - Create `src/app/api/inventory/[id]/route.ts` using Next.js dynamic route handlers
   - Implement GET method to retrieve item by ID
   - Add data loading from inventory.json
   - Implement error handling for not found or invalid requests
   - Add appropriate HTTP status codes and responses

2. **Inventory Service Extension**:
   - Extend `src/services/inventoryService.ts` with getById method
   - Implement error handling for failed requests
   - Add caching for individual items
   - Create retry logic for network failures
   - Implement response transformation if needed

3. **Data Structure Enhancement**:
   - Extend existing inventory data with detailed fields
   - Add support for multiple images
   - Include 360-degree image data if available
   - Add detailed specifications
   - Ensure location data is complete for mapping

4. **Sample Data Creation**:
   - Enhance `src/content/inventory.json` with comprehensive item details
   - Include realistic data for UI testing
   - Create sample images and 360-degree assets
   - Add varied data types for different inventory items

- [ ] Implement API Route Handler (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Create `src/app/api/inventory/[id]/route.ts`
  - [ ] Implement GET method to retrieve item by ID
  - [ ] Add data loading and filtering
  - [ ] Implement error handling for invalid IDs
  - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes

- [ ] Extend Inventory Service (AC: 2, 4, 7)
  - [ ] Add getById method to `src/services/inventoryService.ts`
  - [ ] Implement error handling
  - [ ] Add caching mechanism
  - [ ] Create retry logic
  - [ ] Add response transformation if needed

- [ ] Implement Caching Strategy (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create caching for individual items
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation
  - [ ] Add cache expiration logic
  - [ ] Optimize for performance

- [ ] Create Unit Tests (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Write tests for API route handler
  - [ ] Create tests for inventory service extension

## Testing Approach

1. **API Testing**:
   - Verify API route handler functions correctly
   - Test handling of valid and invalid IDs
   - Check error responses
   - Verify data structure matches requirements
   - Test with various item types

2. **Service Testing**:
   - Test getById method functionality
   - Verify error handling
   - Check caching behavior
   - Test retry logic
   - Verify response transformation

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test service integration with API
   - Verify end-to-end data flow
   - Check error propagation
   - Test with realistic data scenarios

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure response times
   - Test caching effectiveness
   - Verify memory usage
   - Check network optimization
