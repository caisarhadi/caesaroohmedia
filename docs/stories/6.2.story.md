# Story 6.2: Map Component Implementation

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement the core map component and integration with the chosen mapping library
- so that users can visualize OOH sites on an interactive map interface

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Main mapping page is created in `caesarooh/src/app/map/page.tsx` as a CSR page
2. Map wrapper component is implemented in `caesarooh/src/components/map/MapWrapper.tsx`
3. Map integration with the chosen library (Mapbox GL JS, MapLibre GL JS, or Leaflet) is complete
4. Basic map controls (zoom, pan, full-screen) are implemented
5. Map component integrates with the map service and store from Story 6.1
6. Map component loads and displays properly across all device sizes
7. Map styling supports both dark and light themes
8. Unit and integration tests are created for the map components

## Technical Context

This story builds on Story 6.1 to implement the core map components for the Advanced Mapping Page as specified in Epic 6. Key components:

1. **Map Page**: Client-side rendered page for the interactive map interface
2. **MapWrapper Component**: Core component that encapsulates map library logic
3. **Map Controls**: Basic interaction tools for the mapping interface

Key references:
- Map Page requirements: `docs/epic-6.md`
- Map service and store: From Story 6.1 (`caesarooh/src/services/mapService.ts` and `caesarooh/src/stores/mapStore.ts`)
- Map library documentation (specific to the chosen library)
- Next.js CSR implementation: https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering

## Implementation Notes

1. **Map Page Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/app/map/page.tsx` as a Client-Side Rendered page
   - Implement 'use client' directive for client components
   - Set up responsive layout structure
   - Add metadata for SEO
   - Create loading and error states
   - Set up integration with the map store

2. **MapWrapper Component Implementation**:
   - Create `caesarooh/src/components/map/MapWrapper.tsx` component
   - Implement the chosen mapping library integration
   - Create initialization and cleanup logic
   - Add viewport management
   - Implement theme support
   - Add responsive behavior for different devices

3. **Map Controls Implementation**:
   - Add zoom controls
   - Implement pan functionality
   - Create full-screen toggle
   - Add geolocation button if applicable
   - Ensure touch support for mobile devices
   - Style controls to match the application theme

4. **Map Styling and Theming**:
   - Implement custom map styles for the application
   - Create theme-specific map styles (dark/light)
   - Ensure proper contrast and readability
   - Optimize for performance
   - Create responsive styles for different devices
