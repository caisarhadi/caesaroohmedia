## Implementation Notes

1. **Bundle Analysis Implementation**:
   - Configure `@next/bundle-analyzer` in the Next.js application
   - Analyze bundle size and composition
   - Identify large dependencies and unused code
   - Create strategy for code reduction
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Add lazy loading for non-critical resources

2. **Image Optimization Implementation**:
   - Verify usage of `next/image` component throughout the application
   - Implement responsive image sizes
   - Add proper image formats (WebP, AVIF where supported)
   - Optimize image loading with proper priorities
   - Add blur placeholders for improved user experience
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

3. **Lighthouse Audit and Improvements**:
   - Conduct Lighthouse audits for all key pages
   - Analyze results for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
   - Address critical performance issues
   - Implement Web Vitals optimizations
   - Add caching strategies where appropriate
   - Optimize third-party script loading

4. **SSR/SSG Strategy Verification**:
   - Review and verify SSR implementation for detail pages
   - Confirm SSG usage for static content
   - Implement Incremental Static Regeneration where appropriate
   - Optimize data fetching patterns
   - Reduce server response times
   - Implement streaming SSR if beneficial

5. **SEO Optimization**:
   - Review and enhance metadata across all pages
   - Implement structured data for relevant content
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Add canonical URLs where needed
   - Create or update sitemap.xml
   - Verify robots.txt configuration
