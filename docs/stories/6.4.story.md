# Story 6.4: Map Filtering and Search Functionality

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to implement filtering and search functionality for the map interface
- so that users can easily find and explore specific OOH sites and POIs

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Filter panel component is implemented in `src/components/map/MapFilterPanel.tsx`
2. Search functionality is implemented for OOH sites and POIs
3. Filtering by media type, availability, and other criteria is supported
4. Radius search functionality is implemented to show nearby OOH sites or POIs
5. Map view updates dynamically based on filter and search criteria
6. Filter and search state is managed through the map store
7. Components support both dark and light themes
8. Components are responsive and usable on all device sizes
9. Unit and integration tests are created for all components

## Technical Context

This story builds on Stories 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 to implement the filtering and search functionality for the Advanced Mapping Page as specified in Epic 6. Key components:

1. **Filter Panel**: UI component for applying filters to the map view
2. **Search Functionality**: Tools to search for specific OOH sites or POIs
3. **Radius Search**: Feature to show nearby items within a specified distance

Key references:
- Map Page requirements: `docs/epic-6.md`
- Map service and store: From Story 6.1 (`src/services/mapService.ts` and `src/stores/mapStore.ts`)
- Map component: From Story 6.2 (`src/components/map/MapWrapper.tsx`)
- Marker components: From Story 6.3 (`src/components/map/OOHMarker.tsx` and `src/components/map/POIMarker.tsx`)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Filter Panel Implementation**:
   - Create `src/components/map/MapFilterPanel.tsx` component
   - Implement filter controls for various criteria (media type, availability, etc.)
   - Add clear/reset functionality
   - Create collapsible/expandable design for mobile
   - Implement responsive layout
   - Add theme support
   - Connect to map store for state management

2. **Search Functionality Implementation**:
   - Add search input for OOH sites and POIs
   - Implement search by address, OOH ID, and other attributes
   - Create autocomplete suggestions if applicable
   - Add results display
   - Implement map centering on selected result
   - Connect to map service for data retrieval
   - Manage search state through map store

3. **Radius Search Implementation**:
   - Add radius selection control
   - Implement geospatial query to find nearby items
   - Create visual radius indicator on map
   - Add user-defined or preset radius options
   - Connect to map service for data filtering
   - Manage radius state through map store

4. **Dynamic Map Updates**:
   - Implement filter application to map view
   - Create smooth transitions for map updates
   - Add loading indicators for data fetching
   - Optimize for performance with large datasets
   - Implement marker updates based on filter changes
   - Ensure proper handling of view bounds
