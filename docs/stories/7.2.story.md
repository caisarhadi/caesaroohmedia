# Story 7.2: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance

## Status: Approved

## Story

- As a developer
- I want to conduct comprehensive testing across all features, devices, and themes
- so that we can ensure a high-quality, bug-free application before launch

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Unit tests are completed for all components and services with appropriate coverage
2. Integration tests are implemented using React Testing Library
3. End-to-end tests are created using Playwright for critical user flows
4. Manual user acceptance testing (UAT) is conducted and documented
5. All tests are passing across both dark and light themes
6. Responsive testing is completed for all key pages on various device sizes
7. Edge cases and error scenarios are thoroughly tested
8. Test documentation and reports are created
9. Critical bugs are fixed and verified

## Technical Context

This story is part of Epic 7's finalization phase, focusing on comprehensive testing to ensure quality before launch. Key components:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and services in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing how components work together
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows
4. **Theme and Responsive Testing**: Ensuring consistent experience across themes and devices

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Test Strategy**:
   - Use Jest for component and service testing
   - Employ React Testing Library for component rendering
   - Implement snapshot testing where appropriate
   - Focus on behavior-driven tests
   - Use mock services for dependency isolation
   - Verify both success and failure scenarios

2. **Integration Test Strategy**:
   - Test component compositions
   - Verify store interactions
   - Test form validation and submission
   - Verify API integration
   - Test navigation between components
   - Focus on user interactions

3. **End-to-End Test Strategy**:
   - Test complete user journeys
   - Verify multi-page workflows
   - Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Include mobile device testing
   - Test performance under realistic conditions
   - Implement visual regression testing

4. **Theme and Responsive Testing Strategy**:
   - Test theme switching
