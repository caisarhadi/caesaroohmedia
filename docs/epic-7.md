* **Epic 7: Finalization, Optimization & Launch Prep**
    * **Goal:** Populate all pages with final content and data, rigorously optimize the entire application for performance and SEO, conduct thorough testing across all features, devices, and themes, ensure full accessibility compliance, and prepare for a successful launch.
    * **Key Frontend Implementation Details (derived from Design Architect notes):**
        * The "Optimize for performance/SEO" story needs to include specific tasks such as: running bundle analysis (e.g., using `@next/bundle-analyzer`), performing thorough image optimization checks (compression, correct formats, responsive sizes via `next/image`), conducting Lighthouse audits for all key pages and addressing identified issues, and verifying that all SSR/SSG strategies are correctly implemented and effective.
        * The "Test thoroughly" story must ensure that all defined levels of testing (unit, component, integration with RTL; E2E with Playwright; manual UAT) are completed comprehensively. This includes testing all user flows, edge cases, dark/light themes, and responsiveness. Accessibility testing using tools like Axe and manual checks (keyboard, screen reader) must be part of this.
        * Conduct a final, dedicated review of accessibility compliance against WCAG 2.1 Level AA across all pages, components, and themes before launch.
