# Caesar OOH Media Component Library

Welcome to the Caesar OOH Media component library. This library contains all the foundational UI components used in our application.

## Component Philosophy

Our components follow the Shadcn/ui-inspired approach:

- Custom, composable, and accessible components built from scratch
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Developed and documented in Storybook
- Support for both light and dark themes
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility built-in

## Component Categories

The component library is organized into the following categories:

### Common Components

Basic UI elements that are used throughout the application:

- **Button**: Various styles for actions including primary, secondary, and outline variants
- **Card**: Flexible container for content with optional header and footer sections
- **Icon**: Standardized icon system using SVG icons
- **Form inputs**: Text inputs, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons with support for validation

### Layout Components

Components that help structure the page layout:

- Container
- Grid
- Section
- Page layout components

### Theme Support

All components support both light and dark themes. The theme can be toggled using the theme toggle in the toolbar.

## Usage Guidelines

### Installation

These components are part of the Caesar OOH Media application and are not distributed as a separate package.

### Accessibility

All components are built with accessibility in mind:

- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader support

### Custom Styling

Components accept class name props that allow you to customize their appearance.

## Development

### Adding New Components

When adding new components:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate directory within `src/components/`
2. Create a corresponding story file for Storybook
3. Export the component in an index file
4. Document the component's props and usage

### Modifying Existing Components

When modifying components:

1. Ensure backward compatibility
2. Update the component's story file
3. Test the component in both light and dark themes
4. Verify accessibility
