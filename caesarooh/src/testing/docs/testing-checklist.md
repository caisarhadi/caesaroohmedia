# Testing Checklist for Developers

Use this checklist when implementing new features or making changes to ensure proper test coverage.

## Unit Testing Checklist

- [ ] Identify all utility functions and helpers that need testing
- [ ] Write tests for each function's expected behavior
- [ ] Include tests for edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Verify functions with side effects or async behavior work correctly
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in recursive or complex functions
- [ ] Ensure 100% code coverage for critical utility functions

## Component Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify components render correctly with default props
- [ ] Test component behavior with different prop values
- [ ] Check that user interactions (clicks, typing, etc.) work correctly
- [ ] Verify conditional rendering logic
- [ ] Test error states and loading states
- [ ] Ensure accessibility features (aria roles, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Test component lifecycle behaviors (mount, update, unmount)

## Integration Testing Checklist

- [ ] Identify component combinations that work together
- [ ] Test parent-child component interactions
- [ ] Verify context providers and consumers work together
- [ ] Test form input, validation, and submission
- [ ] Check that data flows correctly between connected components
- [ ] Verify event handling across component boundaries
- [ ] Test routing and navigation between components

## API Testing Checklist

- [ ] Set up MSW handlers for each API endpoint used
- [ ] Test successful API calls and data rendering
- [ ] Verify error handling for failed API requests
- [ ] Test loading states during API calls
- [ ] Check authentication-related API behavior
- [ ] Test retry logic and request cancellation if applicable
- [ ] Verify correct headers and parameters are sent

## E2E Testing Checklist

- [ ] Identify critical user flows for E2E testing
- [ ] Test complete user journeys from start to finish
- [ ] Check form submissions and multi-step processes
- [ ] Verify navigation and routing in real browser
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Check performance issues in real-world scenarios
- [ ] Include cross-browser tests for critical features

## State Management Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test store initialization with default values
- [ ] Verify state updates through actions and reducers
- [ ] Test selectors and derived state
- [ ] Check state persistence and rehydration
- [ ] Verify state changes propagate to components
- [ ] Test error handling in state-changing operations
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in store subscriptions

## Final Project Checklist

- [ ] All critical code paths have tests
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum project requirements
- [ ] No flaky tests in the test suite
- [ ] Tests run in a reasonable time
- [ ] All tests pass in local environment
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] Test documentation is up-to-date
