**Prompt 1 (Revised for Full Page Coverage): For AI High-Fidelity Mockup Tools**

```text
Objective: Generate a comprehensive set of high-fidelity mockups for the ENTIRE CAESAR OOH MEDIA website, covering ALL pages defined in the site architecture. This platform is for an out-of-home advertising provider in Indonesia, serving as an informational hub, industry insight resource, and an OOH inventory exploration/marketplace tool. The design must embody a modern, sleek, clean, premium, highly usable, and technologically advanced aesthetic. Generate mockups for both light and dark themes. Target WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility in visual design choices (especially color contrast). Mobile-first responsive design is critical; provide views for mobile (e.g., 390px width) and desktop (e.g., 1440px width) for ALL listed pages.

Project Name: CAESAR OOH MEDIA Website Modernization

Key Visual & Branding Cues (to be interpreted and applied by the AI):
* **Overall Aesthetic:** Sophisticated, premium, technologically advanced, minimalist where appropriate to avoid clutter, user-centric.

**Prompt 2 (Revised for Full Page Coverage): For AI Frontend Code Generation Tools (like Vercel v0, Lovable/Bolt)**

```text
Objective: Generate Next.js (v14+ App Router, TypeScript) frontend code for ALL pages of the CAESAR OOH MEDIA website as defined in the project's Information Architecture. The site is an OOH advertising platform with informational content, an inventory marketplace, and advanced mapping. Prioritize creating a modular, performant, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), and responsive (mobile-first) application.

Key Technologies & Architectural Principles:
* Framework: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript).
* Styling: Tailwind CSS v4.x (utility-first, JIT, `dark:` variant for dark mode).
* State Management: Zustand for global/complex feature state.
* Animations: GSAP for sophisticated UI animations. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* Mapping: Mapbox GL JS (or a compatible alternative â€“ assume Mapbox for now).
* Component Philosophy: Shadcn/ui-inspired (custom, composable, accessible components styled with Tailwind, built from scratch or headless primitives). Storybook for documentation (you generate code, not stories).
* Data Handling (V1): Local files. Next.js API Route Handlers (`/app/api/...`) serve data from `src/content/` (JSON for inventory/map, Markdown for insights).
* Rendering Strategy:
    * SSR: `/insight` (list & detail), `/inventory` (list & detail).
    * CSR: `/mapping`.
    * SSG/ISR: `/about-us`, `/solutions`, `/contact-us` (initial view).
* Contact Form Backend: Self-hosted Next.js API route (`/app/api/contact`) using Nodemailer.
* Directory Structure: Adhere to structure from Frontend Architecture Document v0.3 (e.g., `src/app`, `src/components`, `src/store`, etc.).

Global Elements & Features Implementation:
1.  Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`): HTML structure, body, ThemeProvider for dark/light mode.
2.  Main Group Layout (`src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`): Includes `Header`, `Footer`, `DrawerNav`.
3.  Theme Management (`src/store/uiStore.ts`, ThemeProvider/hook): Zustand store for `currentTheme`, `localStorage` persistence, `<html>` class toggle.
4.  Header Component (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`): Logo placeholder, Menu Toggle (for `uiStore.isDrawerNavOpen`), Dark/Light Mode Toggle Switch.
5.  Drawer Navigation (`src/components/layout/DrawerNav.tsx`): Controlled by `uiStore`, GSAP animated, accessible, links: Homepage, About Us, Solutions, Insight, Mapping, Inventory, Contact Us. Active link style.
6.  Footer Component (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`): Compact Contact Form Snippet (submits to `formService`), Contact Details, Office Map Snippet placeholder, Social Media Links, Copyright.
7.  Sticky Utility Buttons (`src/components/layout/StickyUtilityButtons.tsx`): "Back to Top", "Direct WhatsApp Chat".

Page Scaffolding & Key Component Generation (for ALL pages based on Site Map in UI/UX Spec v1.0 - `/`, `/about-us`, `/solutions`, `/insight`, `/insight/{slug}`, `/mapping`, `/inventory`, `/inventory/{id}`, `/contact-us`):

* **For each page listed above, generate the page file (e.g., `src/app/(main)/about-us/page.tsx`) and any unique, significant components primarily used on that page.**
* **Homepage (`src/app/(main)/page.tsx`)**: Sections for Hero, Intro, Summaries (Solutions, Mapping, Inventory, Insight) with `next/link` CTAs. GSAP Vertical Twin Scrolling placeholder.
* **About Us Page (`src/app/(main)/about-us/page.tsx`)**: Structure for mission, vision, values, history sections.
* **Solutions Page (`src/app/(main)/solutions/page.tsx`)**: Structure to detail OOH solutions and benefits.
* **Insight List Page (`src/app/(main)/insight/page.tsx` - SSR)**: Fetch summaries via `/api/insight/`. Display using `InsightCard.tsx` (responsive: horizontal swipe mobile). Breadcrumbs.
* **Insight Article Detail Page (`src/app/(main)/insight/[article-slug]/page.tsx` - SSR)**: Fetch content via `/api/insight/[article-slug]/`. `ArticleRenderer.tsx` for Markdown. "Reading Mode" toggle. Breadcrumbs.
* **Mapping Page (`src/app/(main)/mapping/page.tsx` - CSR `use client`)**: `MapWrapper.tsx` (for Mapbox GL JS). UI for Search, Filter Panel toggle. `MapFilterPanel.tsx`. Fetch data via `mapService.ts` from `/api/map-data/`. `OOHSiteInfoPanel.tsx` (details, map snippet, 360 view option). Zustand `mapStore.ts`.
* **Inventory List Page (`src/app/(main)/inventory/page.tsx` - SSR)**: Fetch list via `/api/inventory/` (server-side, with filter/sort params). `InventoryFilterPanel.tsx`. Display items via `InventoryCard.tsx`. Skeleton loading for cards. Pagination. Breadcrumbs.
* **Inventory Detail Page (`src/app/(main)/inventory/[item-id]/page.tsx` - SSR)**: Fetch item via `/api/inventory/[item-id]/`. `DetailGallery.tsx`. `ThreeSixtyViewerWrapper.tsx`. Specs display. Embedded `MapWrapper.tsx` snippet. "Enquire Now" CTA. `SharingOptions.tsx` (PDF, Print, Email, WhatsApp). Breadcrumbs.
* **Contact Us Page (`src/app/(main)/contact-us/page.tsx`)**: Main contact form (client validation, submit via `formService.ts` to `/api/contact`). Success/error feedback. Embedded map for office.

Key Reusable Components (scaffold in `src/components/common/` or feature folders):
* `Button.tsx`, `Modal.tsx`, `SkeletonLoader.tsx`, `Input.tsx` (and other form elements as needed, built accessibly).
* Specific components mentioned above like `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `DrawerNav.tsx`, `MapWrapper.tsx`, `InventoryCard.tsx`, `InsightCard.tsx`, `ArticleRenderer.tsx`, `OOHSiteInfoPanel.tsx`, `DetailGallery.tsx`, `ThreeSixtyViewerWrapper.tsx`, `SharingOptions.tsx`.

API Route Handlers (Examples - generate basic structure):
* `src/app/api/inventory/route.ts` & `src/app/api/inventory/[item-id]/route.ts`: GET handlers reading from `inventory.json` (with filtering for list).
* `src/app/api/insight/route.ts` & `src/app/api/insight/[article-slug]/route.ts`: GET handlers reading from Markdown files.
* `src/app/api/map-data/route.ts`: GET handler for `map-ooh-sites.geojson` and `map-pois.geojson`.
* `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`: POST handler using Nodemailer (include SMTP env var placeholders). Basic request validation.

Generation Guidelines:
* Generate functional React components with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
* Include basic ARIA attributes for accessibility. Use `next/link` for navigation, `next/image` for images.
* Implement basic loading states (e.g., for API calls, skeleton components as specified).
* Provide clear comments for TODOs, complex logic, or areas needing further integration (e.g., "TODO: Integrate actual 360 library here", "TODO: Implement full filtering logic for inventory API", "TODO: Implement Reading Mode state and style changes").
* Code should be clean, readable, and follow Next.js App Router conventions.
* Assume type definitions exist in `src/types/` (e.g., `OOHInventoryItem`, `InsightArticle`, `POI`, `ContactFormPayload`).

This prompt aims for comprehensive scaffolding of the entire site structure and key functionalities. Human review and significant refinement will be necessary.
